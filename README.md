Assume you have two independent case-control datasets, e.g. males and females, that have been genotyped for M1 and M2 variants (SNPs), respectively. You select a subset of these, N1 and N2, as being particularly promising, for example, because they are significant or because they show odds ratios exceeding 10 each. Upon combining N1
 and N2 into a single dataset (spreadsheet), you find that N12 of these variants are common between the two groups. How likely is this occurring just by chance, or can you conclude that group 2 represents a significant replication for group 1 by virtue of these N12 common variants?
